# SDOT Trees

Exploration of the Seattle Department of Transportation Trees dataset.
You can find the dataset on the [Seattle GeoData SDOT Trees Page](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/sdot-trees/explore).
Download the CSV version to use it with the code included in this repository.
For my purposes, I've renamed the CSV to `SDOT_Trees_CDL_20241119.csv` from its original name to note the date it was downloaded.
You may have to adjust the CSV file name in files to account for your particular file.
