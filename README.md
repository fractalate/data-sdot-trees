# Seattle Department of Transportation Trees

Exploration of the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) Trees dataset.
You can find the dataset on the [Seattle GeoData SDOT Trees Page](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/sdot-trees/explore).
Download the CSV version to use it with the code included in this repository.
For my purposes, I've renamed the CSV to `SDOT_Trees_CDL_20241119.csv` from its original name to note the date it was downloaded.
You may have to adjust the CSV file name in files to account for your particular file.

This project also relies on the World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP) dataset.
You can download it [on the WCVP file server](http://sftp.kew.org/pub/data-repositories/WCVP/). You want to download `wcvp_dwca.zip`, version 13.

<!-- clean this up when I have a complete idea of which datasets I'll use -->
